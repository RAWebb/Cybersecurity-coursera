Cybersecurity-coursera
==========================

This repo for the CyberSecurity Specialization at Coursera.

I'll create a branch for each class, possibly a sub-branch for each project, but probably not necessary for these courses.  Actually even using GitHub is probably completely unnecessary.

No branch for Course #1 - Usable Security

Branch for Software Security class #2 has project1 
* project 1 is working with the C code in Wisdom-alt.c
* Our goal is to find & exploit several memory vulnerabilities in the code.  There are "hidden easter eggs" in the code which allow you to access unintended functions by feeding the executable program bad input.
